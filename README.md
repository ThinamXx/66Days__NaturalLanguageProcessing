**Day1 of 66DaysOfData!**
- **Natural Language Processing:** Natural Language Processing is a field of Linguistics, Computer Science, and Artificial Intelligence concerned with the interactions between Computers and Human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of Natural Language Data. Today I am learning Natural Language Processing from very begining. I have read and Implemented the Fundamentals of Natural Language Processing. Here, I have provided the short description of various Libraries, Dependencies and Modules required for Natural Language Processing. I have also presented the Processing of Text such as Removing the Retweet Text, Removing the Hyperlinks and Removing Hashtags. I hope you will gain some insights and work on the same. I hope you will also spend some time learning the Topics mentioned above. Excited about the days ahead !!

**Day2 of 66DaysOfData!**
- **String Tokenization:** In Natural Language Processing, String Tokenization is a process where the string is splitted into Individual words or Individual parts without blanks and tabs. In the same step, the words in the String is converted into lower case. The Tokenize Module from NLTK or Naural Language Toolkit makes very easy to carry out this process. In my Journey of Natural Language Processing, Today I have learned about String Tokenization, Stop word and Punctuation in Natural Language Processing. I have implemented TweetTokenizer and presented the process to remove Stopwords and Punctuation from the Tokenized Tweets here in the Snapshot. I hope you will gain some insights and work on the same. I hope you will also spend some time learning the Topics mentioned above. Excited about the days ahead!!

**Day3 of 66DaysOfData!**
- **Stemming in Natural Language Processing**: Stemming is a process of converting a word to its most General form or Stem. It's basically the process of removing the suffix from a word and reduce it to it's root word. It helps in reducing the size of Vocabulary. In my Journey of Natural Language Processing, Today I learned about Stemming in Natural Language Processing which is one of the most important steps while working with Text. I have presented the Implementation of Porter Stemmer, Snowball Stemmer and Lancaster Stemmer here in the Snapshot. I hope you will gain some insights and work on the same. I hope you will also spend some time learning the Topics mentioned above. Excited for coming days!!
  - **Porter Stemmer:** It is one of the most common and gentle stemmer which is very fast but not very precise.
  - **Snowball Stemmer:** It's actual name is English Stemmer is more precise over large Dataset.
  - **Lancaster Stemmer:** It is very aggressive algorithm. It will hugely trim down the working data which itself has pros and cons.

**Day4 of 66DaysOfData!**
- **Lemmatization in Natural Language Processing**: Lemmatization is the process of grouping together the inflected forms of words so that they can analysed as a single item, identified by the word's Lemma or a Dictionary form. It is the process where individual tokens from a sentence or words are reduced to their base form. Lemmatization is much more informative than Simple Stemming. Lemmatization looks at the surrounding text to determine a given words's part of speech where it doesn't categorize the phrases. In my journey of Natural Language Processing, Today I learned about Lemmatization and it's simple implementation using Spacy as well NLTK. I have covered the fundamentals of Natural Language Processing such as Tokenization, Stemming and Lemmatization. I hope you will gain some insights and work on the same. I hope you will also spend some time learning the Topics mentioned above. Excited for the days ahead!!

  - Dollar sign ( $ ) matches the characters of the end of word.
  - Dot symbol ( . ) matches any single character.
  - Caret symbol ( ^ ) matches the characters of the start of word.
  - Question mark ( ? ) specifies the previous character is optional.
  - Plus sign ( + ) means one or more instances of the preceding item.
  - Sign ( * ) means zero or more instances of the preceding item.

**Day15 of 66DaysOfData!**
- **Singular Value Decomposition or SVD:** The words that appear most frequently in one topic would appear less frequently in the other, otherwise that word wouldn't make a good choice to separate out the two topics. Therefore, the Topics are Orthogonal. The SVD algorithm factorizes a matrix into one matrix with orthogonal columns and one with orthogonal rows along with diagonal matrix which contains the relative importance of each factor.
- **NonNegative Matrix Factorization or NMF:** Non Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a factorization or constrain of non negative dataset. NMF is non exact factorization that factors into one short positive matrix.
- **Topic Frequency Inverse Document Frequency or TFIDF:** TFIDF is a way to normalize the term counts by taking into account how often they appear in a document and how long the document is and how common or rare the document is.
- In my journey of Natural Language Processing, Today I have learned and Implemented about SVD, NMF and TFIDF in Topic Modeling Project. I have captured just the overview of the implementations here. I hope you will gain some insights and work on the same. I hope you will also spend some time learning the Topics from the Course mentioned below. Excited about the days ahead!!

By using the UNK Token, It will be easy to handle Tokens at Test time that were never seen in Training Instance.
  - **The Vectorizer Class:** The second stage of going from a Text Dataset to a vectorized minibatch is to iterate through the Tokens of an Input Data Point and convert each Token to its Integer form. The result of this iteration should be a Vector. Because this Vector will be combined with Vectors from other Data points, there is Constraint that the Vectors produced by the Vectorizer should always have the same length.
  - **The DataLoader Class:** The Final step of Text to Vectorized minibatch pipeline is to actually group the Vectorized Datapoints. Because grouping into mini batches is a viatal part of Training the Neural Networks, PyTorch provides a built in class called DataLoader for coordinating the Process.
